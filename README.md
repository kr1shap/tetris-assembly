* **Clean UI**: All pieces and the board are drawn directly to the framebuffer.
* **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  * Collision detection
  * Piece rotation using the rotation matrix (no manual rotation done here!)
  * Line clearing with animation
  * Gravity with increasing speed over time
  * Nice, implemented UI using different colours, game state screens and an overall nice look
* **Full Set of Tetriminos**: Implements all 7 classic Tetris shapes.

## üí´ Extra Features

As a part of the assignment, we were required to add a couple of extra features, to make it as close as the real game can be! 

* **Sound effects** for gameplay events
* **Animated line clears**
* **Score tracking** with real-time updates [this was painful to do]  

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How to Play

Feel free to use a simulator such as Saturn. You can use it online [here](https://1whatleytay.github.io/saturn) or download the Saturn app. However, I find that using it online results in little to no visual glitches, while I found the application had visual glitches during re-rendering.
